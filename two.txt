Executive Summary
The IHS platform enables healthcare providers to extend credit financing to patients. In 2024, the baseline tech stack was defined. The 2025 revamp upgrades key components to ensure scalability, performance, compliance, observability, and AI readiness.
Architecture Principles
• Scalability: Handle millions of patient finance events in real-time.
• Performance: Optimize processing with low latency.
• Security & Compliance: HIPAA/GDPR ready.
• Observability: End-to-end visibility across layers.
• Future-ready: Cloud-native + AI-driven architecture.
Section-wise Analysis

Impact:
* • Faster ingestion
* • Better parallelism
IHS Benefit:
* • Reduced loan approval turnaround
* • Scalable under load
Messaging
2024: Kafka, RabbitMQ
2025: Kafka 3.x, Pulsar/Redpanda (POC)
Why in 2025: Kafka 3.x brings KRaft, tiered storage. Pulsar/Redpanda cloud-native options.
Impact:
* • More reliable event streaming
* • Resilience at scale
IHS Benefit:
* • No loan event loss
* • Smooth demand spikes handling
Caching
2024: Redis, Memcached, Hazelcast, Infinispan, Geode, Guava
2025: Redis Stack 7.x (JSON, Search, Vector DB)
Why in 2025: Adds advanced search + AI-ready vector storage.
Impact:
* • Sub-ms response
* • Supports AI fraud detection
IHS Benefit:
* • Faster eligibility checks
* • AI risk analysis ready
Database
2024: MySQL, Cassandra
2025: PostgreSQL 16, Cassandra/ScyllaDB
Why in 2025: Postgres adds JSONB, analytics. Cassandra/Scylla handle scale.
Impact:
* • Hybrid SQL+NoSQL
* • Faster queries
IHS Benefit:
* • Reliable transactions
* • Better reporting
Micro-Frontends
2024: React, NextJS, RemixJS, FrintJS, PuzzleJS
2025: NextJS 14 + Module Federation
Why in 2025: Supports independent deployable frontend modules.
Impact:
* • Faster modular releases
* • Less team dependency
IHS Benefit:
* • Independent eligibility/loan UIs
* • Faster innovation
DevOps & Infra
2024: Docker, Kubernetes, Maven, Gradle
2025: Kubernetes 1.30+, Helm, ArgoCD, GitHub Actions, Terraform
Why in 2025: Adopts GitOps + IaC for stability.
Impact:
* • Reproducible infra
* • Lower release risk
IHS Benefit:
* • Reliable deployments
* • Dev productivity up
Observability
2024: ELK
2025: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, OpenSearch, New Relic (APM, RUM, Replay)
Why in 2025: Adds proactive alerts, SaaS observability with New Relic.
Impact:
* • Full visibility
* • Faster MTTR

* • Traceable patient workflows
* • Better UX debugging
Security
2024: Generic principles
2025: Zero-Trust, OIDC, Vault, mTLS, Encryption
Why in 2025: Enhances HIPAA/GDPR compliance.
Impact:
* • Data secure
* • Better secret mgmt
IHS Benefit:
* • Protects patient data
* • Compliance ready
